My project is a frontend-only Trello-like task management interface that I created as an exercise to enhance my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. 
It has fundamental features like creating, editing, deleting, and repositioning task cards via drag-and-drop. 
The design is responsive, and all the interactions are managed with vanilla JavaScript, without any frameworks. 
The objective of this project was to have hands-on experience with DOM manipulation, event handling, and creating interactive UIs. 
It's an independent project with a sole focus on the frontend, without any backend or database integration.
